1.Take n numbers as input in to an 1-d  array A from user; write a C program
to compute and display the minimum, maximum, sum, and average of the elements.

2. WAP to reverse the contents of a  array of n elements.

3. WAP to search an element in a  array of n numbers.

4. Given an unsorted  array of size n, WAP to find and display the number of
elements between two elements a and b (both inclusive).

5. Given a array, WAP to print the next greater element (NGE) for every
element. The next greater element for an element x is the first greater element on the
right side of x in array. Elements for which no greater element exist, consider next
greater element as -1. E.g. For the input array [2, 5, 3, 9, 7], the next greater elements
for each elements are as follows.
Element NGE
2  5
5  9
3  9
9  -1
7  -1

6. Let A be square  matrix. WAP by using appropriate user defined functions
for the following:
a) Find the number of nonzero elements in A
b) Find the sum of the elements above the leading diagonal.
c) Display the elements below the minor diagonal.
d) Find the product of the diagonal elements.

7. Define a structure for representing a point in two-dimensional Cartesian co-ordinate
system. Now, write a C program to perform the following tasks:
a. Compute the distance between two given points.
b. Compute the area of a triangle, given the co-ordinates of its three vertices.

8. Write a C program that:
a. Uses Structure to store name, roll no., marks, and address of 5 students in C
programming subject;
b. Displays the stored information.
